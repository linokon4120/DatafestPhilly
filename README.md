# DatafestPhilly
DataFest Philadelphia is part of the national American Statistical Association DataFestâ€”a 48-hour case competition where teams of two to five students receive a rich, complex dataset from a large company and analyze it for insights. Our team from Bucknell University will compete in the competition this year.
